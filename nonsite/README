index.php 
 - This is the login page. This redirects to checklogin.php upon form submission.

checklogin.php
 - This page checks that a user is registered and has the correct password. It then redirects to game.php or back to index.php if the user doens't exist.

signup.php 
 - This page is a form that takes user information and sends it to createaccount.php. This shows an error if the password is too short, doesn't match, or the username is taken.

createaccount.php
 - This page inserts into the user table and authentication table using a hashed password. It then redirects to game.php.

header.php
 - This displays an image at the top of the page that is a link back to index.php.

game.php
 - The main logic for the game is located here. This gets user information, defines the map, displays the stats, and handles location changes and events using JQuery. This does JQuery calls to update.php and changestats.php.

update.php
 - This handles moving from one location to another. It changes the user's location in the database and changes stats based on distance travelled as well as the weather outside.

changestats.php
 - This changes user stats based on the event that the user is doing (work, exercise, etc.). This actively queries the database.

logout.php
 - This page closes the user's session and redirects to index.php. This is called from pressing the logout button.
